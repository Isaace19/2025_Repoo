/* Next Steps to writing Pthread/DSO Practice program
 *
 * 1. Create worker thread function - calls func from .so file do work then return result back to marhsaller/parent
 *
 * 2. Next, spawn multiple threads now that step 1 is confirmed (ideally variable amount)
 *
 * 3. Work with sending terminate signals to the spawned threads (pthread_cond_broadcast)
 *
 * Final Stage: spawn multiple waiting threads dole out work, function calls.
 * within worker function, and utilize pthread_cond_wait and should return unique function
 * values to parent to be printed out to stdout to show all the unique pthread ids
